    <h1>TEXT</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>
        HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g.
        headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
      </li>
      <li>
        They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be
        placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a
        quotation ).
      </li>
    </ol>

        <h4><b>WHITE SPACES</b></h4>
        <p>
          In order to make code easier to read, web page authors often add extra
          spaces or start some elements on new lines. <br />
          When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other,
          it only displays one space. <br />
          Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single
          space too. This is known as white space collapsing. <br />
          You will often see that web page authors take advantage of white space
          collapsing to indent their code in order to make it easier to follow.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>tag br use for break and its self closed</li>

        a question or starting a new conversation or giving details like
        <blockquote>
          <p>why you want to learn full stack devolpement?</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <p>
        As per my search and in IT market
        <q> Full stack devolper skills are most demadable and highly paid </q>
      </p>
      <li>
        tag q use for short paragraph and its use in tag p and tag q use for
        highlight to answer
      </li>
      <li>
        tag abbr use short form of big words or company name like
        <abbr title="professor">PROF</abbr>
        <abbr title="johnson">JOHN</abbr>
        <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space 
        Administration">NASA</abbr>
        <abbr title="doctor">DR</abbr>
        <li> The first time you explain some 
            new terminology (perhaps an 
            academic concept or some 
            jargon) in a document, it is 
            known as the defining instance 
            of it.
            The <dfn> element is used to 
            indicate the defining instance of 
            a new term.
            Some browsers show the 
            content of the <dfn> element in 
            italics. Safari and Chrome do not 
            change its appearance   </li>
      <li>When you are referencing a 
        piece of work such as a book, 
        film or research paper, the 
        <cite> element can be used 
        to indicate where the citation is 
        from. <br>
        In HTML5, <cite> should not 
        really be used for a person's 
        name â€” but it was allowed in 
        HTML 4, so most people are 
        likely to continue to use it.
        Browsers will render the content 
        of a <cite> element in italics.</li>
            <li>The <address> element has 
                quite a specific use: to contain 
                contact details for the author of 
                the page.
                It can contain a physical address, 
                but it does not have to. For 
                example, it may also contain a 
                phone number or email address
                like <address>
                    <p>
                        <a href="mailto">is5127006@gmail.com</a>
                        <a href="phone">+923025127006</a>

                    </p>
                    <p>House NO:1 QAYYUMABAD KARACHI </p>
                </address>
            </li>
